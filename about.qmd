Hi! I'm Annika Shivam, a rising senior in Austin, Texas. I hope to major in computer science in college.

I created this project because I've always been interested in figuring out what makes a song popular and was excited to use data science help me explore it deeper. If you have any questions about this project, here is [my Github](https://github.com/booleansarebinary) and you can email me at booleansarebinary@gmail.com.

This project was created as a part of [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
